  <h3 style="font-family:courier;"class="text-center"> Here's is a timeline of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ's Life: </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>570 C.E - </b>Born in Makkah and his father, ‘Abdullah dies before he's born.</li>
  <li><b>576 C.E - </b>At only six years old, his mother also passed away.</li>
  <li><b>595 C.E - </b>Married Khadija bint Khuwailid when he was 25 years old.</li>
  <li><b>610 C.E - </b> Received revelation from Angel Gabriel. 
  <li><b>613-619 C.E. - </b>The Prophet Muhammad initially kept the revelations private, confiding only in a small circle of family members and close friends.</li>
  <li><b>613-619 C.E. - </b>Over time, the Prophet Muhammad began to preach to his own tribe members, and then throughout the city of Makkah.</li>
  <li><b>613-619 C.E. - </b>The Makkan tribes organized a social boycott of the Muslims, not allowing people to trade with, care for, or socialize with the Muslims.</li>
  <li><b>619 C.E - </b>The Prophet Muhammad’s beloved wife Khadija and his uncle/caretaker Abu Talib both died. Without Abu Talib’s protection, the Muslim community experienced increasing harassment in Makkah.
  <li><b> 622 C.E - </b> The Prophet and his follower immigrated to Madina.</li>
  <li><b>624 C.E - </b>Battle of Badr: Two years after the migration, the Makkan armies gathered outside of Madinah. The Muslims were outnumbered 3:1 but were successful in defending against the invading army.</li>
  <li><b>625 C.E - </b> Battle of Uhud: the Makkans came back even stronger. This Battle was less decisive, and taught the Muslims an important lesson about over-confidence and greed.</li>
  <li><b>628 C.E - </b> The Muslims conquered Makkah.</li>
  <li><b>632 C.E - </b> The Prophet passes away.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="font-medium">"My choice of Muhammad to lead the list of the world's most influential persons may surprise some readers and may be questioned by others, but he was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the religious and secular level."</p>
